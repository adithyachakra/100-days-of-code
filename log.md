# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote HTML code and began CSS for a cartoon animal image.

**Thoughts:** The HTML was quite simple for this one, but the CSS was a bit harder. Deciding the numerical values for exactly how large each element should be was a bit difficult. I also enjoyed splitting up the image into its component parts (e.g: ears, head, eyes, etc.) - really simplified the process.

### Day 2: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML and CSS code for a cartoon animal image! Yay!

**Thoughts:** I started out by using random values for the padding (height, width, top, left/right) so my first attempt looked pretty off - the nose was not even on the face and the ears weren't attached to the head. I used trial and error to get the right sizes/positions for the various body parts. I orginially planned on having nostrils and hair on the animal, but I got lazy (SORRY!) and decided to remove them, which is why the .nostril and .hair divs are gone from the CSS/HTML files. But overall, this was very satisfying!

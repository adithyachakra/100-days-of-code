# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote HTML code and began CSS for a cartoon animal image.

**Thoughts:** The HTML was quite simple for this one, but the CSS was a bit harder. Deciding the numerical values for exactly how large each element should be was a bit difficult. I also enjoyed splitting up the image into its component parts (e.g: ears, head, eyes, etc.) - really simplified the process.

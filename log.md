# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote HTML code and began CSS for a cartoon animal image.

**Thoughts:** The HTML was quite simple for this one, but the CSS was a bit harder. Deciding the numerical values for exactly how large each element should be was a bit difficult. I also enjoyed splitting up the image into its component parts (e.g: ears, head, eyes, etc.) - really simplified the process.

### Day 2: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML and CSS code for a cartoon animal image! Yay!

**Thoughts:** I started out by using random values for the padding (height, width, top, left/right) so my first attempt looked pretty off - the nose was not even on the face and the ears weren't attached to the head. I used trial and error to get the right sizes/positions for the various body parts. I orginially planned on having nostrils and hair on the animal, but I got lazy (SORRY!) and decided to remove them, which is why the .nostril and .hair divs are gone from the CSS/HTML files. But overall, this was very satisfying!

### Day 3: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started HTML and CSS code for a design webpage.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to create a page with a circle that grows bigger and smaller every 1 second using CSS animation. For some reason, the webpage is displaying blank so I cannot see it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

### Day 4: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed my HTML/CSS code! 

**Thoughts:** It took a very very very long time to fix - but once I figured out what was wrong, it was immensely satisfying! Right now, the website doesn't really do/show anything - it is just an animation of two circles coming together while the background flashes different colours. In upcoming days, I would like to add some fuctionality to the page. Perhaps, if the user clicks one button, it will trigger an animation which provides more information. I might use some JavaScript or SVG for that.

### Day 5: August 28, 2018 (I'm sorry!)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to animate CSS code so that the graphics move when they are hovered over.

**Thoughts:** I  was not able to animate the circles when I hovered over them. The animations work, but (a) they are not triggered by :hover and (b) I am unsure how to trigger both circles to move when I hover over only one of them, because the :hover function is only attached to one of the graphics.

### Day 6: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a Java Program that would compare prices of products on the Staples website.

**Thoughts:** This was very fun - a refreshing change from doing only front-end programming for the first five days! I managed to make the program output the prices of the products, but the productName Element (array) did not work, so the program does not yet output the name of the product beside the price. Tomorrow, I will fix that error and hopefully find a way to compare the prices as well!

### Day 7: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Changed the Java program so that it would output names as well. I also added a class that would arrange the prices by descending/ascending order.

**Thoughts:** I fixed the bug from Day 6 quite easily, but encountered some new bugs when trying to convert from the Jsoup elements form to arrays, and then converting the strings in the array to doubles so that I could compare them, and then all back to elements so that they could be outputted in the main class. (Just realized this, perhaps they don't have to be converted back to elements in the main class - that would make the job a lot easier. I guess that's what I'm doing tomorrow!)
